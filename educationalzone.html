          Dangers of Preservatives and Processed Food
        </h2>
        <p>
          Processed foods often contain a myriad of additives, including
          preservatives, artificial colors, and flavor enhancers, designed to
          extend shelf life and enhance taste. While convenient, the regular
          consumption of these foods can pose significant health risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Preservatives like nitrates, nitrites, and BHA/BHT have been linked to
          various health issues. Nitrates and nitrites, commonly found in cured
          meats, can form potentially carcinogenic compounds in the body. BHA
          and BHT, used to prevent spoilage in fats and oils, have raised
          concerns regarding their potential to interfere with endocrine
          function and contribute to tumor growth in animal studies.
        </p>
        <div class="hidden-content">
          <p>
            Regular consumption of processed foods is associated with an
            increased risk of obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and certain
            types of cancer. They often lack the satiety provided by whole
            foods, leading to overeating and a vicious cycle of unhealthy eating
            habits.

          Genetically Modified Crops and Their Health Effects
        </h2>
        <p>
          Genetically modified organisms (GMOs), particularly crops, are a
          contentious topic. These crops have had their DNA altered using
          genetic engineering techniques, often to introduce traits like pest
          resistance or herbicide tolerance...

      NOW THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE DANGERS OF PRESERVATIVES AND GENETICALLY
      MODIFIED CROPS, LET'S LOOK AT HOW TEHNOLOGY CAN MAKE NATURAL FOOD MORE
      ACCESSIBLE
    </p>
    <div>
      <ol class="first-paragraph">
        <li>
          Digital technology can transform food system in three ways. First, it
          can expand farmers’ access to capital and resources. With the touch of
          a button on their phone, farmers can now rent machines—like
          tractors—that require significant capital to buy
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Digital technology can also disrupt value chains through economies of
          scale, allowing smaller players to be integrated into the value chain.
          For example, e-commerce platforms can link producers directly to
          consumers, relaxing the constraint that producers need to be a certain
          size to reach customers.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Finally, digital technology can disrupt the management of natural
          resources through precision tools, helping to boost food production
          sustainably. Digital technologies can make information on land, soils
          and other resources more widely available, allowing farmers to apply
          inputs like fertilizer and water in a more precise manner.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <h2 class="first-h2">Here are real life success stories</h2>
    <div>
      <ol class="second-paragraph">
        <li>
          Twiga Foods, a Kenyan company founded in 2014, uses mobile technology
          to connect smallholder farmers directly with urban vendors, making
          fresh, natural produce more accessible and affordable. Through a
          simple app, vendors order fruits and vegetables, which Twiga collects
          from farms and delivers efficiently using data-driven logistics. This
          system reduces food waste, cuts out costly middlemen, and ensures
          farmers are paid quickly via mobile money. As a result, consumers get
          fresher food at lower prices, and farmers earn more, making natural
          food both accessible and sustainable.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Guests at LSU AgCenter’s annual wheat and oat field day in April got
          the chance to attend a drone presentation. Discussion came up about
          how drones can be used to track the health of crops, especially in
          observation plots. “One of the things we’re thinking about in using
          drone data is that we have 600 or so plots that are observation plots
          and have DNA for all of them, which can be expensive. We wanted to
          learn if we could use drone information to link those observations
          together without the DNA data,” plant geneticist Noah DeWitt.

          Remote work is not something farmers have been able to consider in the
          past. But some technology can make it easier for farmers to work away
          from their land, whether that’s in their home next to their family, or
          while traveling. An app developed by Missouri farmer Nathan Holmes,
          Pump Trakr, works to manage irrigation through an on-farm
          communication tool. Farmers sign up to a subscription service to have
          real-time irrigation monitored and logged into a record.
