        <p>
          Welcome to CareLink, a space born from the collaborative spirit of the
          Kode With Klossy Program's Web Development Class of 2025. More than
          just a website, CareLink represents the journey of four young women
          who came together with a shared goal: to turn curiosity into code and
          creativity into connection. This platform is a testament to the skills
          and knowledge we've gained — from learning the fundamentals of web
          development to applying them in ways that are both practical and
          meaningful. Throughout the program, we challenged ourselves to think
          critically, design intentionally, and collaborate openly, transforming
          ideas into an interactive and engaging digital experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          This project is the culmination of the hard work, dedication, and
          ingenuity of its creators: Asma Sassi, Ferachukwu Angel Okonkwo,
          Helena Ruppenthal, and Mariam El-Sayed Ibrahim. Each of us brought our
          unique voice, background, and passion to the table. Together, we
          leveraged a diverse set of coding tools — from HTML and CSS to
          JavaScript — to bring this vision to life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Beyond the lines of code, we’re artists, storytellers, and thinkers.
          Our hobbies range from painting and photography to reading fantasy and
          political literature, and of course, enjoying movies and social media
          moments that spark joy. These interests influence the way we see and
          shape the world, and they helped guide the aesthetics and
          functionality of CareLink. We all joined KWK with the shared intention
          of expanding our skill sets in a space that encourages learning,
          collaboration, and empowerment — a space full of brilliant, ambitious
          girls just like us.
          <br />
          <br />
          We placed a strong emphasis on creating a user-friendly experience,
          with intuitive navigation and thoughtful design choices that reflect
          our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility. From the structure of
          the pages to the visual details, every element was crafted with
          intention and care.
          <br />
          <br />
          CareLink is not just a portfolio of our technical growth — it's a
          reflection of the community that inspired us, the friendships that
          supported us, and the potential we now see in ourselves to build,
          lead, and create in tech and beyond.
